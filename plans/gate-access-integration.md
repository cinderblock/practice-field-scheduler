# Gate Access Integration (scheduler side)

## Goal

Let practice-field teams open the physical gate during their reserved slot,
without ever handing out the gate-controller API key. The scheduler is the
**source of truth** for who may use what, when. **Gate Manager** (separate
repo) is a stateless thin proxy that asks the scheduler "is this token allowed
to open `gate` right now?" on every interaction and pulses the gate if yes.

Designed generically so future tools (bathroom unlock, door locks, music)
reuse the same endpoint with a different `tool` identifier. See
"Home Assistant" below — those future tools all live in HA.

## Environment / context

- Repo: `C:\Users\camer\git\playgrounds\practice-field-scheduler`
- Branch: `gate-access-integration` (base: `master`)
- Package manager: **npm** (`package-lock.json`). This project is _not_ on the
  Bun list — don't "fix" it to Bun.
- Checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit` (vitest), `npm run check`
  (biome + prettier). `npm run check:write` to autofix.
- Counterpart repo: `C:\Users\camer\git\Personal Projects\Gate Manager`
  - Integration contract: `docs/scheduler-integration.md` — **keep in sync.**
  - Consumes the DM'd link at `route("g/:token", "routes/team-enroll.tsx")`.
    **Verified present**, so `${GATE_BASE_URL}/g/<token>` is correct.
  - Gate Manager talks to **pigate** (`GATE_API_BASE_URL=https://pigate.tomsawyerlabs.com`),
    _not_ to Home Assistant. `src/gate-client.ts` → `POST /pulse`.
- Related, owned by a _different_ session in a separate worktree:
  `t3code/admin-blackout-days` at
  `C:\Users\camer\.t3\worktrees\practice-field-scheduler\t3code-b9d31dd3`.
  **Do not do blackout-days work in this tree.**

### New env vars

| Var                  | Purpose                                                    | Unset behaviour                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `SCHEDULER_API_KEY`  | Shared bearer secret Gate Manager presents                 | `/api/access/check` returns 503 |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`    | Bot token (`xoxb-`, scope `chat:write`) for DMs            | DMs become logged no-ops        |
| `GATE_BASE_URL`      | Public Gate Manager base, for `${base}/g/<token>`          | link omitted from DMs           |
| `STRICT_SLACK_NAMES` | `"true"`/`"1"` rejects logins with malformed display names | soft mode: warn only            |

## Decisions already made (don't re-ask)

- **Per-TEAM tokens.** One link per team, shared among its members. _(User
  decision, 2026-09-15 — this reversed an earlier per-user design that a
  previous session had already built and committed in `70299a3`.)_ Keep the
  code structured so **per-user can return later** without another rewrite —
  hence the principal-based evaluator below.
- **Access window: `slot_start − 20 min` … `slot_end + 60 min`.** _(User
  decision, 2026-09-15.)_ Replaces the earlier 30 min / 6 h asymmetry.
- **Gate only for now.** `bathroom` and friends come later; the endpoint is
  already generic over `tool`.
- **Rotation triggers:** on the team's request, on an admin's request, or at
  season rollover (year change).
- **Rotating DMs the team the new link automatically** — otherwise the new
  link is stranded and the old bookmark dies silently.
- **Admin UI reveals the link on explicit action** (not shown by default) —
  so an admin can hand it over when Slack DMs aren't working for someone.
- **Admins get no automatic gate access** by virtue of being admins; they'd
  get it through team membership like anyone else.
- **Every answer is HTTP 200** with a `{valid, reason, …}` envelope; only
  auth/config/transport problems use non-2xx. Matches the Gate Manager brief.
- **Fail-closed is Gate Manager's job**, not ours — we answer honestly.
- **Slack failures never break login or reservation flows.** All DMs are
  fire-and-forget, logged on failure.
- **Name convention** `First Last (1234)`, multi-team `First Last (1234, 5678)`,
  plus approved non-team marker `First Last (TSL)` for lab mates (validates,
  but parses to zero teams so it grants no gate access).
- Rollout order: nudge users via the admin audit panel **first**, then flip
  `STRICT_SLACK_NAMES=true`.

## Home Assistant — forward plan

**Grounding (verified live against the `ha-tsl` instance, 2026-09-15):**

| Thing      | Entities that exist today                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gate       | `button.gate_controller_gate_pulse`, `script.gate_open`, `sensor.gate_controller_gate_state`, `binary_sensor.gate_controller_throttled`, plus hold/auto-off automations |
| Bathroom   | `script.bathroom_unlock`, `script.bathroom_unlock_new`, `timer.bathroom_unlock`, `sensor.bathroom_unlock_countdown`, `automation.bathroom_unlock_keep_pressing_kastle`  |
| Door locks | **none yet** — the `lock` domain is empty                                                                                                                               |
| Music      | not yet surveyed; will be `media_player.*`                                                                                                                              |

So the bathroom's "unlock for 2 minutes" already exists in HA as a script +
timer. The gate is the odd one out: it's reachable _both_ via HA and via
pigate directly, and Gate Manager currently uses pigate.

**The architectural call: the scheduler must NOT talk to Home Assistant.**

The scheduler stays a pure **policy authority** — it answers "may this token
use tool X right now?" and nothing else. A separate **executor** owns the
device call. Reasons:

- The scheduler is internet-facing and holds no device credentials today.
  Giving it a long-lived HA token makes it a much more attractive target —
  a scheduler compromise would become a _building_ compromise.
- HA is on the LAN; the scheduler may move to the cloud (the integration
  brief explicitly wants that move to stay free).
- Policy and actuation have different failure modes and different rates of
  change. Adding a music integration shouldn't require a scheduler deploy.
- It keeps the existing fail-closed story intact and unchanged.

**Recommended shape:**

```
  browser → Gate Manager (executor) ──ask──→ Scheduler  (policy: yes/no + window)
                    │
                    ├──→ pigate           (gate pulse, today)
                    └──→ Home Assistant   (bathroom, locks, music — later)
                            POST /api/services/script/bathroom_unlock
```

Gate Manager grows from "gate proxy" into a small **tool broker**: one
`tool` → one HA service call, with its own `HA_BASE_URL` + long-lived token,
staying on the LAN. It already has the session, admin UI, audit log and
fail-closed behaviour that the other tools would otherwise each reinvent.

**What the scheduler needs to change to be ready (not yet done):**

1. Turn `SUPPORTED_TOOLS` (a hard-coded `string[]`) into a small **tool
   catalog**: `{ id, label, windowPolicy }`. Adding `bathroom` becomes a
   catalog entry rather than surgery on the evaluator.
2. Allow **per-tool windows**. The gate reasonably opens 20 min early; a
   bathroom unlock might want a wider window, and music probably wants to
   stop _exactly_ at slot end. The evaluator already computes a window per
   reservation — it needs to take the policy as a parameter.
3. Consider a per-team **tool allow-list** (a team might get gate but not
   music). The denial reason `tool_not_authorized` already exists for this
   and is currently only returned for unknown tool ids.

None of that is needed for gate-only, so it's deliberately deferred — but
the catalog refactor should land _before_ the second tool, not after.

**Rules of engagement for HA itself:** infrastructure is off-limits without
per-change authorization. Reading state to ground a design is fine; creating
or editing automations, scripts, helpers or dashboards is not, absent an
explicit yes for that specific change. If HA work is authorized later,
consult the `home-assistant-best-practices` skill first.

## Plan / steps

1. ✅ `/api/access/check` endpoint + bearer auth + zod validation.
2. ✅ Slack client, welcome/reminder DMs, name parsing, `STRICT_SLACK_NAMES`,
   `/login` bad-name UI, admin Slack-name audit panel. _(commit `70299a3`)_
3. ⬅️ **CURRENT** — Rework per-user → **per-team** tokens:
   - `TeamAccess` record + `data/<year>/teamAccess.json`; drop
     `UserEntry.accessToken` (scrub on load, as was done for the old
     per-reservation `token`).
   - Principal-based evaluator so per-user stays one small step away.
   - Grace → 20 min / 60 min.
   - Track which link each user was last DM'd, so rotation self-heals on
     next login instead of needing separate bookkeeping.
4. Admin UI: list teams, reveal-on-demand, rotate (DMs the team).
5. Season-rollover rotation.
6. Remove the `title=` tooltip in `NameAuditPanel.tsx`.
7. README section; re-sync `Gate Manager/docs/scheduler-integration.md`.

## Findings / gotchas

- **`git status` shows ~75 modified files; only a handful actually differ.**
  The rest is CRLF noise from `core.autocrlf`. Use `git diff --numstat`.
  Don't "fix" line endings.
- **`Lock` is not reentrant** (see `src/server/util/Lock.ts`). Acquiring twice
  on one path deadlocks. This is why `restrictToTeam` / `restrictToAdmin` /
  `restrictTimeframe` are `await`ed: they resolve `this.user` (which may take
  the lock) **before** the caller takes it. **Any new code that acquires
  `changeLock` must not also `await this.user` inside the critical section.**
- `git stash create` does **not** capture untracked files — a safety stash is
  not sufficient protection when new files are in play. Commit early.
- Gate Manager does _not_ use Home Assistant for the gate; it uses pigate.
  Don't assume HA is already in that path.
- There is no `lock` domain in HA yet — door-lock control is genuinely future
  work, not just un-wired.
- Baseline at takeover: typecheck ✅, 89 unit tests ✅, biome+prettier ✅.

## Progress log

- [x] Read WIP `89578d5` + the uncommitted follow-on work.
- [x] Confirmed `/g/:token` exists in Gate Manager — DM'd links resolve.
- [x] Confirmed baseline checks pass before adding anything.
- [x] Safety snapshot `stash@{0}` (tracked files only).
- [x] Committed the per-user implementation as `70299a3` (superseded in part
      by step 3, but keeps the Slack/name/audit work safe and reviewable).
- [x] Surveyed Home Assistant for gate / bathroom / lock / music entities.
- [ ] Per-team rework (step 3).
- [ ] Admin rotate + reveal UI (step 4).
- [ ] Season rollover (step 5).
- [ ] `title=` removal, README, contract re-sync (steps 6–7).

## Open questions for the user

1. **Season rollover rotation — automatic or prompted?** Recommendation:
   **prompted**. Silently rotating on Jan 1 would break every team's bookmark
   with no warning and fire a DM storm. Better: detect that a token predates
   the current season, show "new season — rotate recommended" in the admin UI,
   and let an admin do it (one click, all teams).
2. **Do house/special teams need links too?** `houseTeams` exists and team ids
   can be non-numeric strings. Assuming yes, same treatment — flag if not.

## Things not to do

- Don't do blackout-days work in this tree — another session owns that branch.
- Don't give the scheduler Home Assistant credentials (see above).
- Don't change HA automations/scripts without explicit per-change approval.
- Don't switch this project to Bun.
- Don't add `title=` attributes anywhere.
- Don't `git checkout --` / `restore` / `reset --hard` to tidy the tree.
